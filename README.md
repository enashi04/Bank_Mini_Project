# 🏦 Banking Project — Term Deposit Campaign Optimization

In a highly competitive banking environment with growing pressure on profitability, marketing campaigns must be increasingly targeted, efficient, and measurable. The success of financial products such as term deposits largely depends on a bank’s ability to identify the right customer profiles, anticipate their behavior, and personalize its approach.

This project is part of a strategic initiative to leverage data analysis and machine learning to improve marketing performance in the banking sector.

🎯 Project Objectives:
- Explore and analyze customer data to extract strategic insights
- Apply advanced statistical methods to validate findings
- Provide actionable strategic recommendations
- Predict whether a client will accept ("yes") or decline ("no") a term deposit offer (with streamlit)
